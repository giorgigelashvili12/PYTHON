# module - A file containing python code. May contain functions, classes and etc.
# Used with modular programming, which is to seperate a program into parts

# If you quit Python interpreter and enter it again, the functions and variables you created are lost.
# (Interpreter in python - A python Interpreter is a computer program that converts each high- level
# program statement into a machine code. An interpreter translates the command that you write out
# into code that the computer can undestand.). Therefore, if you want to write/create a longer program
# it's better writing programs in text editor (You are using it but still).

# code examples:
# to import code from the other file, write: import {file_name}
import secondary

secondary.greet()
secondary.bye()
